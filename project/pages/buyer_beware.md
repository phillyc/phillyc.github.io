I'm a first time Fiverr user, so maybe I just made a mistake in trusting this community, but here's my story.

I recently started working on a personal blog to post articles about programming. I wanted to get a quick logo done so I paid [sk_virtuoso][1] a total of $25 to make one for me. I gave this person some simple directions, that I wanted a lion type logo in black. sk_virtuoso came back with two drafts and I picked one. We finalized the deal and I was delivered the source files.

I was quite happy with the work, until I read this article:

[What happens when you pay $5 for a logo.][2]

See, this person figured out that quite a large number of "designers" on Fiverr are just outright stealing work from real designers and selling it as their own. 

Concerned about "my" logo, I dumped it into a reverse image search. Sure enough, I got a hit from a company called [Drasis Technology][3].

I guess I was an idiot for trusting a stranger over the internet. Caveat emptor.
