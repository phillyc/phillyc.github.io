blurb: It’s important to pay attention to the people who want to have a say in how our country is run.

I should start this review by stating that I only read this book because Trump is running for president and at this time, seems likely to lock in the Republican nomination. I think it’s important to pay attention to the people who want to have a say in how our country is run, whether we agree with them or not.

As such, I found [The Art of the Deal][1] to be an interesting insight to how Trump acts and thinks. Certainly he has come under a lot of criticism of late for his braggadocios nature. However, we can see by reading his memoir, first published in 1987, that this outlook on life and business has served Trump very well in the past. In some respects I can understand where it comes from, a relentless optimism and passion for getting things right.

Early on it becomes clear that Trump has a deep axe to grind with government bureaucracy. Trump labels Ed Koch, then mayor of NYC, an incompetent bully over the Wollman Rink deal. It is also clear in Trump’s dealings with the Atlantic City Gaming Commission, that this base level hatred for government ineptitude is not just limited to city mayors.

The thing I find fascinating about Trump, and particularly [The Art of the Deal][1] is his unbound enthusiasm for “winning.” He seems to take great pleasure in getting his way, regardless of the monetary outcome. It is undeniable that he is a master deal maker, as he almost always comes out on top.
