There are tons of tools available to a Mac based professional. Here are the top tools that every developer should check out...

### General tools

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) Note taking, bookmarking, article clipping, planning, etc.
* [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) I'm experimenting with Alfred as a replacement for Quicksilver.
* [Quickcast.io](http://quickcast.io/) Quickly record, edit, and upload 3 minute screen casts. Amazing for product demos.
* [GanttProject](http://www.ganttproject.biz/) An open source, free gantt tool for project management.

### Developer tools

* [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) The very best MySQL database management tool available for Mac.
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) Calling this a text editor is the understatment of the year.
