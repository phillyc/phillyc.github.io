This is a list of my indespensible tools for my Mac Book Pro.

## General tools

    [Evernote][https://evernote.com/] Note taking, bookmarking, article clipping, planning, etc.
    [Quicksilver][http://qsapp.com/] Hotkey application and file launch. Also has a calculator.
    [Quickcast.io][http://quickcast.io/] Quickly record, edit, and upload 3 minute screen casts. Amazing for product demos.
    
## Developer tools

    [Sequel Pro][http://www.sequelpro.com/] The very best MySQL database management tool available for Mac.
    [Sublime Text][http://www.sublimetext.com/] Calling this a text editor is the understatment of the year.
