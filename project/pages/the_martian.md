blurb: The Martian is a fantastic fictional view of what it would take to survive on Mars, even when everything goes wrong.

# Logs, logs, logs
When reading Andy Weir's *The Martian* I'm immediately impressed by the daily log style of writing. 
It's simple, but effective. I'm inspired to renew my efforts to log my daily activity, at least when it comes to work.

I think it's important to have a running log of our lives. As engineers, it makes us think critically about what we are
doing and *why* we are doing it. Also, it presents an opportunity to *remember* where we were, and this is critically
important, due to how easy it is to forget context.

# Unbreakable optimism
One of the stand out characteristics of the main character, Mark Watney, is his unbreakable optimism.

It may seem obvious, but NASA works very hard at picking astronauts that have a lot of grit and determination. This is
inspiring to me, because it's shown over and over that Watney remains optimisitic dispite tremendous odds against his 
survival. This is inspiring on so many fronts, as our daily lives can seem sometimes overwhelming. When everything
is going againts you, remember that optimism is your light against the darkness.
