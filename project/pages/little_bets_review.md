blurb: Peter Sims gives us a tour of why we should think smaller when working on our ideas.

"Immersive inquisitiveness"
Immerse yourself in whatever you are trying to innovate. Without getting down to the "worms-eye view" of things, rather
than the bird's eye view, we miss critical details that may lead to key creative discoveries. Follow this up with
relentless inquisitiveness. When you are unafraid to ask any question, you'll find the right answer faster.
